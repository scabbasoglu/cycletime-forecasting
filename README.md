# forecasting
Apply Montecarlo Experiment to find probability of success for an amount of user stories.

Being inspired by this video: http://www.lkce13.com/videos/magennis/ I'm writing a simple code to make scientific forecasting using real data. It reads start and end dates of tasks form a google spread sheet and gives the chance of completion for given amount of (similar) tasks in expected amount of days.
