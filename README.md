# cycletime-forecasting

Being inspired by this video: http://www.lkce13.com/videos/magennis/ I'm writing a simple code to make scientific forecasting using real data. It reads start and end dates of tasks form a google spread sheet and gives the probability of completion for given amount of (similar) tasks in expected amount of days.
